/**
	\page callback_descr Generic callbacks
	
	The \ref tscb::signal "signal" ... template class provides
	a generic callback mechanism. It allows one object
	(the "sender") to notify an arbitray number of other objects
	(the "receivers") of events by calling specified functions.
	
	The template can be instantiated with at least one and up
	to six template arguments; they allow to customize the signature of the
	callback functions to match the intended use case.
	
	\section callback_declaration Declaration of callback chains
	
	Callback chains are declared as global or member variables; the
	template argument defines the signature of the callback
	functions:
	
	\code
		class MyClass {
		public:
			// will report old and new value to callbacks
			tscb::signal<void (int, int)> onValueChange;
			
			void setValue(int newval);
		private:
			int value;
		}
	\endcode
	
	\section callback_issue Issuing callbacks
	
	Callback chain objects (as declared in the previous example) provide
	an overloaded () operator which will call all callback functions
	registered with this callback chain:
	
	\code
		void MyClass::setValue(int newval)
		{
			int oldval=value;
			value=newval;
			// notify all registered callbacks
			onValueChange(oldval, newval);
		}
	\endcode
	
	The overloaded () operator expects exactly the number and type
	of arguments as were used when the callback chain was declared.
	
	\section callback_register Registration for callbacks
	
	Callback chains provide the \ref tscb::signal::connect "connect"
	template member functions to allow receivers to add a callback
	function to the chain. They can be used in the following fashion:
	
	\code
		class MyObserver {
		public:
			MyObserver(MyClass *c)
			{
				c->onValueChange.connect(boost::bind(&MyObserver::notify_change, this, _1, _2));
			}
		protected:
			void notify_change(int oldval, int newval)
			{
				printf("Value changed from %d to %d!\n", oldval, newval);
			}
		};
	\endcode
	
	In the previous example, the <TT>notify_change</TT> method of the
	corresponding <TT>MyObserver</TT> object would be called
	whenever the callback chain is being activated
	(see section \ref callback_issue above). Note the the
	function object created via <TT>boost::bind</TT> will be
	destroyed as soon as the callback is cancelled (see section \ref callback_cookies below).
	
	The same technique can be used to bind "free" functions:
	
	\code
		char *msg="Incredible!";
		
		void notify_change(char *ctx, int oldval, int newval)
		{
			printf("%s Value changed from %d to %d!\n", ctx, oldval, newval);
		}
		
		int main(void)
		{
			MyObject obj;
			obj.onValueChange.connect(boost::bind(notify_change, msg, _1, _2));
			obj.setValue(42);
		}
	\endcode
	
	Like in the previous example, the function <TT>notify_change</TT>
	will be called whenever the callback chain is being activated.
	
	\section callback_cookies Connection management
	
	The
	\ref tscb::signal::connect "connect" method
	return a reference to a callback connection object that represents the
	connection between the callback service provider and the receiver. The
	return value can be stored by the caller:
	
	\code
		tscb::connection conn;
		conn=c->onValueChange.connect(boost::bind(&MyObserver::notify_change, this, _1, _2));
	\endcode
	
	The link object can later be used to cancel the
	callback:
	
	\code
		conn->cancel();
	\endcode
	
	The callback function will not be invoked subsequently; the data associated
	with the function object will be released as soon as it is guaranteed that
	the callback function cannot be called again (e.g. from other threads).
	This is useful e.g. if <TT>boost::shared_ptr</TT> is used to assist in
	tracking the lifetime of objects:
	
	\code
		tscb::connection conn;
		boost::shared_ptr<MyObserver> obj(new MyObserver);
		conn=c->onValueChange.connect(boost::bind(&MyObserver::notify_change)
			boost::shared_ptr(obj), _1, _2));
	\endcode
	
	In this case, a <TT>boost::shared_ptr</TT> instance is kept for as long as
	the callback can be activated -- thus the object will not be deallocated
	until it is guaranteed that the callback cannot be delivered any longer.
	
	\section Performance
	
	The synchronization mechanism used to protect the integrity of the
	callback chains is \ref tscb::deferred_rwlock. Thus overhead
	incurred by the synchronization mechanism has to be paid for signals
	as well.
	
	The implementation assumes that callback processing (in contrast
	to callback registration/cancellation) is the fast path
	and has been optimized to this end. The performance characteristics
	are thus:
	
	<UL>
		<LI>
			process callbacks: O(number_of_registered_callbacks)
		</LI>
		<LI>
			cancel callback: O(1) (if there is no contention, i.e.
			the chain is not being traversed while cancelling callbacks)
		</LI>
		<LI>
			cancel callback: O(numer_of_cancels^2) (if there is contention,
			i.e. the chain is being traversed while cancelling callbacks)
		</LI>
	</UL>
	
	Some measurements were made to estimate the number of clock cycles
	it takes to call an empty function which takes a single integer parameter:
